<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there! I'm a curious and hands-on learner currently diving into the world of web development. I'm taking Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp, and this site is where I’ll be documenting and sharing the projects I build along the way.
</p>
<p>
I come from a background in Computer Science Engineering with specialization in AIML, with a strong interest in combining hardware with smart software. I've built projects like an automatic waste segregator using Arduino and experimented with IoT in practical, real-world scenarios—like protecting clothes from rain or creating smart dustbins. Now, I’m adding web development to my toolkit so I can bring more interactive, accessible, and user-friendly solutions to life.

<p>
This space is not just a portfolio—it's a learning journey in progress, filled with experiments, breakthroughs, and plenty of late-night bugs. Whether you're here to check out my code, see what I’m building, or learn alongside me, I’m glad you stopped by!

Let’s keep growing, one line of code at a time.
